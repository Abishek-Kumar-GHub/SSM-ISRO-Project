# SSM-ISRO-Project

This project contains a web-based platform to analyze and visualize data obtained from the Scanning Sky Monitor (SSM) onboard India's Astrosat satellite. By addressing challenges such as data complexity, accessibility, and scalability, this system provides researchers with tools to explore and interpret light curves and spectra effectively.

The platform integrates advanced visualization techniques, user-friendly interfaces, and robust data management features to empower astronomers and researchers in time-domain astrophysics.

## Features
- **Data Handling:** Supports multiple file types, including FITS, ORB, and LBT. Handles Level 0, Level 1, and Level 2 SSM data.
- **Visualization:** Interactive light curves and spectra plotted using Plotly.js. Real-time visualization capabilities for transient event analysis.
- **Calibration:** Utilizes the Astropy library for data calibration, ensuring accurate and reliable insights.
- **Directory Management:** Organized file structures for seamless data access and analysis.
- **Collaboration:** Enables users to share data and visualizations within the platform.
- **Security:** Compliance with data privacy regulations.
